# MFGx Software Engineer Exercise

This exercise is intended to let you demonstrate your knowledge of JavaScript, as well as sound design & testing principles. If you're unfamiliar with JavaScript, you may adapt the exercise into a language of your choice. Please be sure to read the requirements in depth, as well as the "What We're Looking For" section to understand how we'll be evaluating your solution.

## Requirements

Write an application to format the given data for Chirp Views into a single string, based on the following requirements:

1. Format the data into a string as follows:
   a. The chirp message itself
   b. The date of the chirp in MM/DD/YYYY format
   c. The number of views the chirp has
   d. The author‚Äôs name
   e. A fire emoji if the chirp has more than 100,000 views.
2. If the formatted string exceeds 140 characters, truncate the chirp message, and append ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù to it until the truncated message and remaining content can fit into 140 characters.

For example, if the following data were given, it the following outputs would be expected:

1. Message: Hello World!

   Formatted Output: Hello World! 06/28/2021 99999 Jack Daniels
2. Message: This is a maximum length chirp because I like writing long chirps. Why? I'm not really sure. Maybe I'm just a rebel.. or maybe it's a phase?
